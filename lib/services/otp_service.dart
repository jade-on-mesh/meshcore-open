///
/// - The companion BLE text pipe is NOT byte-safe. `BufferWriter.writeString`

///   first 0x00 byte. Raw XOR ciphertext is uniformly random — it contains

///   carried as lowercase hex, never as raw bytes, inside a `String`.
/// - Wire compatibility with the Lua app: outgoing OTP payloads are BARE
///   lowercase hex with no marker/prefix of any kind — this matches exactly
///   what `wada.mesh.send_dm`/`wada.mesh.send` puts on the air in the Lua
///   app. There used to be a "OTP1|" marker prefix here; it has been
///   removed because Lua never sends or expects one, and a marker Flutter
///   invented on its own breaks interop with real Lua devices.
///
///   Because there's no marker, incoming-message recognition instead relies
///   on (a) OTP being enabled for the specific contact/channel the message
///   came from, and (b) the message actually looking like ciphertext hex —
///   see [extractCiphertextHex], a direct port of the Lua receiver's own
